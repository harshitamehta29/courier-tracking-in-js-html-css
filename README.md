A courier tracking system is designed to allow users to track the progress and location of their packages or shipments. It provides real-time updates and information about the status of the courier delivery.

In this implementation, the HTML structure includes a form where users can enter their tracking number or any other required information. Upon submitting the form, JavaScript is used to handle the tracking request and retrieve the relevant information from the server.

The JavaScript code interacts with a backend server or API that stores the tracking details. It sends an HTTP request to the server, including the tracking number provided by the user. The server processes the request and returns the necessary tracking information, such as the current status, location, and estimated delivery time.

Once the JavaScript code receives the response from the server, it updates the HTML dynamically to display the tracking information to the user. This may include details such as the package's origin and destination, transit checkpoints, and any additional notes or comments provided by the courier company.

CSS is used to style the HTML elements, providing an attractive and user-friendly interface for the tracking system. This can include defining the color scheme, font styles, layout, and responsive design to ensure the tracking system is accessible on various devices and screen sizes.

Overall, a courier tracking system in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS enables users to easily track the progress of their packages or shipments, providing them with transparency and peace of mind regarding the delivery process.
